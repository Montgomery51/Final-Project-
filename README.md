Solar Tracker 
=============
By: Nathan Montgomery 

What is a Solar Tracker?
========================


  Well to begin a solar tracker is an automated solar panel that will be able to follow the sun along its path during the day.  Automated solar panels could help increase the voltage output of the panels by creating a face on view of the sun during the whole day. So long as you can use energy efficient motors to move the structure it could essentially power itself. 
  
  Initially I wanted to create a solar tracker that could follow the sun, read out wind speed, record temperature and relate its position, and charge its own batteries (Basically an autonomous weather station with solar panels). I had a few setbacks this semester with family issues and ordering parts within the timeline but I was able to create a solar tracker that follows a light sources path, records the panelâ€™s position, and read out the value at which the solar panels are producing voltage and the temperature around the unit.  

  Starting off I want to give credit to Ingeimaks on Arduino project hub https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Ingeimaks/diy-solar-tracker-arduino-project-ita-78ad78 
The initial project shows a solar tracker that follows the sun.  Most of my project was based off the initial starting code Ingeimaks provided for their project.  Although my code differs greatly from the initial project I followed their code and all credit goes to them for the initial idea.  
Basically my solar tracker was attempted to be an improved version of Ingeimaks solar tracker; 

To implement my LCD screen I used code from an open source Arduino page https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/LibraryExamples/HelloWorld 
This page demonstrates how to connect the LCD to the arduino using 6 pins.
The code for the pinouts and how to wire the LCD were followed and adjust so that the LCD would read out the temerature from the LM36 temperature sensor and the voltage from the solar panels.

Hardware 
========
* 1 x Arduino UNO
* 1 x Breadboard (or prototype boards and solder - Used in this project)
* 4 x PhotoResistors 
* 4 x 10k ohm Resistors 
* 1 x 220 ohm Resistor
* 1 x TMP36 Temperature Sensor 
* 2 x Servo motor (Bigger is Better! But not needed)
* 1 x 16 PIN LCD Screen 
* 1 x 10k ohm Potentiometer 
* Solar Panel (Salvaged or new)
* Wire for connections 
* External power supply ... I used a 20v Dewalt battery with an adapter connected to a buck converter (Worked Awesomely good) 
-----------------------
* For The base.... I created my base with a piece of wood, two scrap hinges for a shelf, and I found an old pan / tilt servo bracket with pieces missing....But i made it work 
* The base was supposed to be 3D printed but the 3D printer I had access to decided to melt everything and try to light on fire instead of building my base.... So the base you see in the above picture is what was built.

Wiring diagram picture 
----------------------------
I always find these pictures to be really nice to read when trying out a new project, but also i have created a wiring diagram as well as seen below.

Software
========
If you are going to put this onto an Arduino device I would recommend downloading the Arduino IDE here - https://www.arduino.cc/en/software 

Libraries
---------
My libraries were already isntalled when I got the Arduino IDE but to find these libraries (if you dont have them) you click the tools option on the top toolbar and then manage libraries... Once it pops up you can search LCD for the liquid crystal library and install it and also search for "Servo" and you will be able to download that library.  

```bash
#include <Servo.h>
#include <LiquidCrystal.h>
#include <EEPROM.h>
```

The code I used initially was provided by Ingeimaks (I highly recommend checking out their page https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Ingeimaks/diy-solar-tracker-arduino-project-ita-78ad78 ) they made a beautiful 3D printed base for their tracker. 

  The original code from Ingeimaks assigned values to the photoresistors top left top right and bot left and bot right.  I also did this the difference in our code is that they chose to use their complete analog input and then take an average of those values. (this works but the tracker is jumpy and constantly moves wasting power). I took their code as seen below 
```bash
 //Ingeimaks
  int avgtop = (topl + topr) ; //average of top 
  int avgbot = (botl + botr) ; //average of bottom 
  int avgleft = (topl + botl) ; //average of left 
  int avgright = (topr + botr) ; //average of right 
```
The photo resistors values were mapped from 0 to 50 and then checked for differences in their values in if statements with an error of 3. I found 3 was a very stable amount for error checking after being mapped 0-50 to keep the tracker from jumping back and forth.  (The error in the difference in photo resistor values)   
```bash
  int TopL = map(LightValue0, 0, 1023, 0, 50);     //Top Left PhotoSensor 
  int BotL = map(LightValue1, 0, 1023, 0, 50);    //Bot Left PhotoSensor
  int TopR = map(LightValue2, 0, 1023, 0, 50);   //Top Right PhotoSensor
  int BotR = map(LightValue3, 0, 1023, 0, 50);  //Bot Right PhotoSensor

  int TopDiff = (TopR + TopL) - (BotR + BotL);
  int BotDiff = (BotR + BotL) - (TopR + TopL);
  int LeftDiff = (TopL + BotL) - (TopR + BotR);
  int RightDiff = (TopR + BotR) - (TopL + BotL);
```
To check what direction the servo's both vertical and horizontal the following If statements were made 
```bash
 if (TopDiff > 3 && pVerti != 75){
    pVerti -= 1;
    Verti.write(pVerti); 
  }

  if (BotDiff > 3 && pVerti != 155){
    pVerti += 1;
    Verti.write(pVerti); 
  }

  if (RightDiff > 3 && pHori != 180){
    pHori += 1;
    Hori.write(pHori);
  }

   if (LeftDiff > 3 && pHori != 0){
    pHori -= 1;
    Hori.write(pHori);
  }
```
* You will notice in the statements there are two conditions, well the second condition was made to keep the servo's from over extending the trackers range. I wanted the tracker to be able too look straight up andall the way east to west.  These values would be different if you were to use my code for your servo's. (maybe)
